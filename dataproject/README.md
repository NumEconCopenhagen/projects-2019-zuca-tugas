# Zuca&Tugas

In this project we are collecting data from Statistics Denmark. The data is about income distribution between different socioeconomic status. 
In our first step, we are focusing on the students from the whole country and their types of income :Primary Income, Pre-tax Income and Disposable Income. 
With the respective comments and thoughts, we analyze tables and plot interactive graphs that can show a good picture of the evolution of the incomes, since 2007 until 2017.
Then we analysed the results taking into account macro and external factors.
