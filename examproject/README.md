# Examproject
This exam project code requires no prior dependencies and should run properly.

In this project, we answered the questions proposed by the exam, which includes:
  Human Capital Accumulation 
  AS-AD Model 
  Exchange Economy
  
Some of the economic concepts included in the project are a dynamic consumer problem, consumer utility, labor supply, inflation, demand shocks and Walras-equilibrium.

Using the tools we learned for python, we solved the models and present the results, graphs and questions in the same .ipynb file.
